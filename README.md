# Compressors
A playground for different compression techniques. The design is heavily inspired by chapter on
compression in Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick et al.

# Tools
Different programs and library code that is used for implementing the algorithms themselves, or
for testing binary output

### Bit streams

### Image dump

### String dump

# Compression algorithms

### Run-length encoding
